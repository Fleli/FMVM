#  Overview

## Code Organization

The FMVM Core library provides definitions for components of the FMVM IR standard. These are declared in `/Sources/fmvm-core/IR`, and are `public`Â because they're meant to be initialized directly by the compiler before generating code.

In addition, the library comes with two tools:
- The `Parse` folder helps with parsing textual FMVM to Swift objects. This is used e.g. by the FMVM optimizer to read FMVM IR from a file generated by the compiler and create objects to analyze the code.
- The `Emit` folder, which has some convenience methods for emitting FMVM code (e.g. writing to a file).
